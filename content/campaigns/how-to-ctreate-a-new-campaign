Creating a campaign in Fluentos is very straightforward.  
Here are the steps you need to follow once you log into your Fluentos dashboard.  
1. Click on the **Add New Campaign** button.

2. You will be navigated to a campaign creation page where you need to do the following:  
* Select the website to which you want to publish your campaign.  
* Enter the campaign name.  
* Select the campaign's purpose from the given **Objective** options given in the right-side panel. As soon as you checkmark an option, the design template options will be refreshed accordingly.  
* Now, select the desired template from the given options.  
ðŸ’¡If you do not want to select a template, you can create your own by selecting the layout options from the right panel.  
* As soon as you select a design template or choose your own layout option, you will be navigated to the **Design** step.

3. On the **Design** step, you can customize the selected template using the design options. To switch to different design elements of the template, use the options in the left-side panel; their customization features will appear on the right-side panel. For example, if you want to edit the template's header, click "Header" in the left-side panel, and the header customizable features will appear in the right-side panel. For example, you can change the header's name, choose a different font and color for the text, and change the spacing of the text.  
Once done, click **Next** to go to the publishing step.
